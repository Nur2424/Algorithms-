Steps to solve a Dynamic programming problem:

  ° Identify if it is a Dynamic programming problem.
  ° Decide a state expression with the Least parameters.
  ° Formulate state and transition relationship.
  ° Apply tabulation or memorization.

Step 1: How to classify a problem as a Dynamic Programming Problem? 

  ° Typically, all the problems that require maximizing or minimizing certain quantities or counting problems 
    that say to count the arrangements under certain conditions or certain probability problems can be solved by using Dynamic Programming.

  ° All dynamic programming problems satisfy the overlapping subproblems property and most of the classic
    Dynamic programming problems also satisfy the optimal substructure property. Once we observe these properties in a given problem be
    sure that it can be solved using Dynamic Programming.

Step 2: Deciding the state

  Dynamic Programming problems are all about the state and its transition. 
  This is the most basic step which must be done very carefully because the state transition depends on the choice of state definition you make.

  State:
        A state can be defined as the set of parameters that can uniquely identify a certain position or standing in the given problem. 
        This set of parameters should be as small as possible to reduce state space. 

      Example:

      Let's take the classic Knapsack problem, where we need to maximize profit by selecting items within a weight limit. 
      Here, we define our state using two parameters: index and weight (dp[index][weight]). 
      Think of it like this: dp[3][10] would tell us "what's the maximum profit we can make by choosing from the first 4 items (index 0 to 3) 
      when our bag can hold 10 units of weight?" These two parameters (index and weight) work together to uniquely identify each subproblem we need to solve.
      Just like GPS coordinates need both latitude and longitude to pinpoint a location, 
      our knapsack solution needs both the item range and remaining capacity to determine the optimal profit at each step.
      So, our next step will be to find a relation between previous states to reach the current state.
