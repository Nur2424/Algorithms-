Absolutely! Let me walk you through how this program works step-by-step, like a story of how it solves the maze. üß≠

‚∏ª

üîç Goal of the Program

You‚Äôre trapped in a 2D dungeon (grid).
There‚Äôs a start position ‚ÄòS‚Äô and an exit ‚ÄòE‚Äô, and some walls ‚Äò#‚Äô.

The goal is to find:
	‚Ä¢	If escape is possible, and
	‚Ä¢	What is the minimum time (in minutes) it takes to reach ‚ÄòE‚Äô from ‚ÄòS‚Äô

We can only move:
	‚Ä¢	North, South, East, or West
	‚Ä¢	Not diagonally
	‚Ä¢	It takes 1 minute per move

‚∏ª

üß† High-Level Idea

The program uses a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path from start (‚ÄòS‚Äô) to end (‚ÄòE‚Äô).

Why BFS?

BFS always finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph, like our dungeon (each move takes 1 minute).

‚∏ª

üöÄ Step-by-Step Execution

1. Setup
	‚Ä¢	m: the grid with characters 'S', 'E', '.' (open), and '#' (walls)
	‚Ä¢	R and C: number of rows and columns in the grid
	‚Ä¢	sr, sc: the starting row and column (where 'S' is)

We also define:
	‚Ä¢	visited: keeps track of cells we‚Äôve already been to, so we don‚Äôt go in circles
	‚Ä¢	move_count: how many steps (minutes) we‚Äôve taken
	‚Ä¢	nodes_left_in_layer: how many nodes are left to explore at the current BFS level (1 at start)
	‚Ä¢	nodes_in_next_layer: how many we‚Äôll visit in the next level
	‚Ä¢	reached_end: tells us if we‚Äôve reached 'E'

‚∏ª

2. Starting the BFS

We use two queues:
	‚Ä¢	One for the row positions
	‚Ä¢	One for the column positions

We add the start position (sr, sc) to both queues, and mark it as visited.

‚∏ª

3. Main BFS Loop (solve() function)

We loop while there‚Äôs something in the queue:
	1.	Take a cell from the queue (r, c)
	2.	If it‚Äôs 'E' ‚Üí Done! Set reached_end = True, break
	3.	Else, explore its 4 neighbors (N, S, E, W) using explore_neighbours(r, c)
	4.	After exploring, we decrement nodes_left_in_layer
	5.	If no more nodes left in this layer:
	‚Ä¢	Move to next layer
	‚Ä¢	move_count += 1 (it takes one minute to reach next layer)

‚∏ª

4. Exploring Neighbors (explore_neighbours(r, c) function)

We try to move in all 4 directions:
	‚Ä¢	Check if the new position is inside the grid
	‚Ä¢	Skip it if it‚Äôs a wall or already visited
	‚Ä¢	If it‚Äôs valid:
	‚Ä¢	Add it to the queues
	‚Ä¢	Mark it as visited
	‚Ä¢	Increase nodes_in_next_layer by 1

‚∏ª

5. Ending the BFS
	‚Ä¢	If we reached 'E', return move_count (time to escape)
	‚Ä¢	If the queue is empty and we never reached 'E', return -1 (no escape)

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Example

Let‚Äôs say this is your grid:

S . . #
# # . E

Translates to:

m = [
    ['S', '.', '.', '#'],
    ['#', '#', '.', 'E']
]

The function will:
	‚Ä¢	Start at 'S'
	‚Ä¢	Explore neighbors layer by layer
	‚Ä¢	Find 'E' in the shortest number of moves
	‚Ä¢	Return that count (time)

‚∏ª

üß≠ Why It Works
	‚Ä¢	BFS guarantees shortest path
	‚Ä¢	Layer counting (move_count) gives you time in minutes
	‚Ä¢	visited prevents infinite loops or backtracking
	‚Ä¢	Separate row and column queues simulate moving in 2D
