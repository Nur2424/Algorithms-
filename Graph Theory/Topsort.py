Thatâ€™s completely normal â€” topological sort can be tricky to turn into working code at first! Letâ€™s build it step-by-step together. Below is a super simplified and readable version, followed by an interactive breakdown so you can really see whatâ€™s happening.

ðŸ§ª Example Input

graph = [
    [1, 2],  # 0 -> 1, 2
    [3],     # 1 -> 3
    [3],     # 2 -> 3
    []       # 3 has no neighbors
]

order = topological_sort(graph)
print("Topological Order:", order)

Expected Output (one of the valid orders):

Topological Order: [0, 2, 1, 3]

ðŸ§  What Each Part Does
	â€¢	graph: adjacency list (graph[u] = [v1, v2, ...]) means u â†’ v1, u â†’ v2, â€¦
	â€¢	visited: avoids revisiting nodes
	â€¢	stack: records nodes after all their dependencies are processed
	â€¢	stack.reverse(): because in DFS, we add the node after its children (post-order)

â¸»

ðŸ’¡ Tip for Learning

To practice:
	1.	Draw a small DAG (like 4â€“5 nodes)
	2.	Convert it into an adjacency list
	3.	Walk through the code manually or with print()s at each step
