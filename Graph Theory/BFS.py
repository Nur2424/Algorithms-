Great! Let‚Äôs walk through this Breadth-First Search (BFS) implementation that finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph from a start node s to an end node e.

‚∏ª

üîç What the Code Does

This code performs BFS to find the shortest path (in terms of number of edges) from node s to node e. It does this in three parts:

1. bfs(s, e)
	‚Ä¢	This is the main function you call.
	‚Ä¢	It runs solve(s) to perform BFS starting from node s.
	‚Ä¢	Then it uses reconstruct_path(s, e, prev) to build the actual path from s to e using the prev array.

‚∏ª

2. solve(s)
	‚Ä¢	Runs BFS from the start node s.
	‚Ä¢	Tracks:
	‚Ä¢	visited: nodes that have already been visited.
	‚Ä¢	prev: an array to keep track of the previous node for each node visited.
	‚Ä¢	This helps in reconstructing the path later.

How it works:
	‚Ä¢	Start with the queue containing s.
	‚Ä¢	While the queue is not empty:
	‚Ä¢	Dequeue a node.
	‚Ä¢	Explore its neighbors.
	‚Ä¢	For every unvisited neighbor:
	‚Ä¢	Mark it as visited.
	‚Ä¢	Add it to the queue.
	‚Ä¢	Set prev[neighbor] = current node.

This effectively builds a shortest-path tree rooted at s.

‚∏ª

3. reconstruct_path(s, e, prev)
	‚Ä¢	Traces back from node e to s using the prev array.
	‚Ä¢	Builds the path in reverse order and then reverses it to get the correct direction.

# path = []
# at = e
# while at is not None:
#     path.append(at)
#     at = prev[at]
# path.reverse()

	‚Ä¢	If a path exists, path[0] should be s.
	‚Ä¢	If not, return an empty list.

üß™ Example Breakdown

n = 6
g = [
    [1, 2],     # 0
    [0, 3],     # 1
    [0, 4],     # 2
    [1, 5],     # 3
    [2],        # 4
    [3]         # 5
]

start = 0
end = 5

      0
     / \
    1   2
    |    \
    3     4
    |
    5

BFS from 0:
	‚Ä¢	Queue: [0]
	‚Ä¢	Visit 0 ‚Üí enqueue [1, 2] ‚Üí prev[1] = 0, prev[2] = 0
	‚Ä¢	Visit 1 ‚Üí enqueue [3] ‚Üí prev[3] = 1
	‚Ä¢	Visit 2 ‚Üí enqueue [4] ‚Üí prev[4] = 2
	‚Ä¢	Visit 3 ‚Üí enqueue [5] ‚Üí prev[5] = 3
	‚Ä¢	Done

Reconstruct path from 5 to 0:
	‚Ä¢	5 ‚Üê 3 ‚Üê 1 ‚Üê 0
	‚Ä¢	Final path: [0, 1, 3, 5]

‚∏ª

‚úÖ Output:

Shortest path from 0 to 5 is: [0, 1, 3, 5]


‚∏ª

üìå Summary
	‚Ä¢	BFS guarantees shortest path in unweighted graphs.
	‚Ä¢	The prev[] array helps you reconstruct the path.
	‚Ä¢	Time complexity: O(V + E) where V is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges.

Let me know if you want to modify it for all shortest paths, path existence, or a directed graph!
